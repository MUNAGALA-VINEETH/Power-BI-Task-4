Task 4: Temperature Summary Report
This task focused on creating a summary dashboard of temperature readings. I added key visuals showing the sum, average, min, max, median, and count of temperature values using colorful card visuals. A title was added to reflect the purpose of the dashboard, and each stat was color-coded for better readability. The goal was to create a simple, easy-to-understand summary for end users to interpret sensor behavior at a glance.
